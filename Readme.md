## Requirements
The tool requires **PHP 7.0** or higher to run. Why? *Because this tool was written in 2018!* Still running that old site on PHP 5.6? Move your extensions over to a system with PHP 7.0+ to scan them.

## Installation
Download the latest version from: https://github.com/Tuurlijk/typo3migrate/releases

Or install using composer (skip the init step if you're installing it into an existing project):
```bash
composer init
composer require --update-no-dev  "michielroos/typo3migrate:*"
```

## Usage
Current tools:
* xml2xlf
* fluidNsToHtml
### Convert xml to xlf
Convert a xmllang file to xlf.
```bash
php ./typo3migrate.phar xml2xlf ~/tmp/localllang_db.xml
```
### Convert old Fluid namespaces
Convert old Fluid namespaces {brace style} to html tag with attributes.
```html
{namespace f=TYPO3\CMS\Fluid\ViewHelpers}
<section>
</section>

```
Will become:
```html
<html xmlns:f="http://typo3.org/ns/TYPO3/CMS/Fluid/ViewHelpers"
	  data-namespace-typo3-fluid="true">
<section>
</section>
</html>
```
Command:
```bash
php ./typo3migrate.phar fluidNsToHtml ~/tmp/Template.html
```
