## Requirements
The tool requires **PHP 7.0** or higher to run. Why? *Because this tool was written in 2018!* Still running that old site on PHP 5.6? Move your extensions over to a system with PHP 7.0+ to scan them.

## Installation
Download the latest version from: https://github.com/Tuurlijk/typo3migrate/releases

Or install using composer (skip the init step if you're installing it into an existing project):
```bash
composer init
composer require --update-no-dev  "michielroos/typo3migrate:*"
```

## Usage
Current tools:
* xml2xlf
### Convert xml to xlf
Convert a xmllang file to xlf.
```bash
php ./typo3migrate.phar xml2xlf ~/tmp/localllang_db.xml
```
